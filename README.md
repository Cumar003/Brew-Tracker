# warehouse

We chose to create a Handling warehouses (Vanderlande) management system to manage inventory. The system efficiently tracks and updates inventory levels in real time by interacting with a central database. The system will streamline receiving, storing, and dispatching products within a warehouse.

## Core Functionalities

### **Inventory Retrieval**

- The system must be able to fetch current inventory data from the database.
- Users can search or filter inventory by product ID, name, category, location, or stock level
- Data must be displayed in a user-friendly dashboard/interface (web or desktop)

### **Inventory Update**

The system must support real-time updates to inventory due to:

- Receiving new stock
- Dispatching/shipping items
